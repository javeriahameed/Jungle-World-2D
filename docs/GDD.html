            <p>
                The main objective is to win games and influence people. Victory objectives are the most basic and
                fundamental goals of the game. They're what the player is ultimately trying to achieve what they need to
                do to win. The main thing is that the player should reach the goal and have his reward after passing
                through each and every hurdle. <br>
                1. To complete all levels without getting killed by enemy.
                2. To defeat the final boss to free his family.
                3. To make game level challaging for player to have difficulty winning game.
                4. Make game interesting by providing hidden treasure to players.

            <h3>
                Game Progression
            </h3>
            <p>
                Game progression refers to momentum earned via in game abstraction: Leveling up a character, unlocking a
                new skill, beating level one and going to level two and so on.
                An important element for a jungle world game is its progression and that is divided into player and
                game. The player progression is about the player’s skills improving and how the whole game works. Game
                progression
                is about the momentum earned via in game abstraction. The player try's to leveling up game, unblocking
                the
                new skill, beating enemies and crashing to the new levels. The game basically shows the score, levels
                the about the
                player earned, the lifeline in short, the progress of a game.

                In Game GUI
            </h3>
            <p>
                A GUI in a game is like any other UI, it is interactive. It has menus, buttons, scrollbars and other UI
                elements. The main reason to use that is the player in jungle world game interacts with the game story
                (narrative) and break into the game space (the fourth wall). It helps the player to interact with the
                game in a way like selecting different characters, collecting awards, moving to different features with
                the buttons and different controls. This jungle game GUI includes the external view of the whole game.

            </h3>
            <p>
                There are some rules that are specified for the player and the game:
                1. Player must win the game to achieve his goal.
                2. All levels should be passed.
                3. If player kills the enemy reward is given to the player.
                4. Lifeline increasing objects should be gained to pass the level.
                5. If contracted with the monster the player died.
                6. To unblock the new player or character certain coin and game progression is required.
                7. The game rules go with the mechanics.
                8. If there is no road and the way is full of branches and tress then he has to jump because of the
                physics apply on it.

            <h3>
                Combat
            </h3>
            <p>
                The combat is really useful when it come to fighting in the game. Video game genre based around close
                combat between a limited number of characters, in a stage in which the boundaries are fixed. The
                characters fight each other's until they defeat their opponents or the time expires. As in our game
                Jungle World 2D, the player fights the enemy or monster to live and if he survives he can enter into new
                level and have rewards.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Physics
            </h3>
            <p>
                The basic physic applied on the player and game objects:
                Rigid body applied to the object and the player so that they fall down and not leaning into sky and
                interact with a lot of fundamental physics behaviour, like forces and acceleration. You use rigidbodies
                on anything that you want to have mass in your game.
                Different methodologies are applied to object in jungle game so that it turns out to be a great game. We
                use physics to achieve realistic behavior and special effects. The physics applied to the whole game
                help it to became as much realistic as possible from the player to the each and every level in jungle
                game.

                For start up we have only one main boy character with few small enemies:
                1. Snakes
                2. Wolfs
                3. Hyenas
                The game also has few boss level enemies:
                1. Lions
                2. Tigers
                3. Cheeta

            <p>
                Each level depends on the location of the jungle world. Different locations contain different levels. If
                the location is Maldives Island then it may contain 10 to 12 levels. The next location Bali contains 15
                levels and so on. As the player crosses the all levels of a jungle world it enters into a new level of a
                new location.

                There will be a total of 5 music tracks used throughout the game. There will be a unique title screen
                track and 4 in game music tracks. All tracks will be short looping techno style beats. In game a random
                track will be chosen which fades into another random track. This keeps the flow of music interesting and
                diversified for every individual game session. Each of the in-game tracks are used throughout the course
                of the game and music runs for the full duration of the match.

                In keeping with the cartoony look and feel of the player, the sound effects are generally going to be
                equally comical. The goal here is to have sound effects that closely resemble a Saturday morning
                cartoon. The music is supposed to be upbeat to get the player in the mood to pick some fights. It will
                be techno based and there will be several different tracks which all flow into each other. 22k 16-bit
                mono WAV files will be the desired format for the best tradeoff between quality and space.
